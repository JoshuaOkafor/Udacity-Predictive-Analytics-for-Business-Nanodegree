This repository contains projects for Udacity's [Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analyst-nanodegree--nd008) 

### Project 1: Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics


A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a large set of diamonds, but is unsure how much it should bid. The goal is to use the results from a predictive model to make a recommendation on how much the jewelry company should bid for the diamonds.

- P1: [Predicting Diamond Prices](https://github.com/JoshuaOkafor/Udacity-Predictive-Analytics-for-Business-Nanodegree/tree/main/P1%20-%20Predicting%20Diamond%20Prices)

### Project 2: Predicting Catalog Demand

A home-goods manufacturer wants to predict expected profits from a catalog launch. The goal is to build a linear regression model to provide results and a
recommendation.

- P2: [Predicting Catalog Demand](https://github.com/JoshuaOkafor/Udacity-Predictive-Analytics-for-Business-Nanodegree/tree/main/P2%20-%20Predicting%20Catalog%20Demand)

### Project 3: Data Wrangling

A pet store chain is selecting the location for its next store. The goal is to use data preparation techniques to build
a robust analytic dataset and use it to build a predictive model to select the best location.

- P3: [Select Location of a new Pet store](https://github.com/JoshuaOkafor/Udacity-Predictive-Analytics-for-Business-Nanodegree/tree/main/P3%20-%20Data%20Wrangling)

### Project 4: Classification Models

A bank recently received an influx of loan applications. The goal is to build and apply a classification model to
provide a recommendation on which loan applicants the bank should lend to.

- P4: [Predicting Default Risk](https://github.com/JoshuaOkafor/Udacity-Predictive-Analytics-for-Business-Nanodegree/tree/main/P4%20-%20Classification%20Models)

### Project 5: A/B Testing

A chain of coffee shops is considering launching a new menu. Design and analyze an A/B test and
write up a recommendation on whether the chain should introduce the new menu.

- P5: [A/B Test a New Menu Launch](https://github.com/JoshuaOkafor/Udacity-Predictive-Analytics-for-Business-Nanodegree/tree/main/P5%20-%20AB%20Testing)

### Project 6: Time Series Forecasting

A video game producer is planning production levels. Use time series forecasting models to forecast
monthly demand and provide a recommendation to help match supply to demand.

- P6: [Forecast Video Game Sales](https://github.com/JoshuaOkafor/Udacity-Predictive-Analytics-for-Business-Nanodegree/tree/main/P6%20-%20Time%20Series%20Forecasting)

### Project 7: Segmentation and Clustering

A grocery store chain is planning a significant expansion. Use multiple analytical techniques to
provide recommendations on how to expand. 

- P7: Capstone Project: [Predictive Analytics Capstone](https://github.com/JoshuaOkafor/Udacity-Predictive-Analytics-for-Business-Nanodegree/tree/main/P7%20-%20Segmentation%20and%20Clustering)
