This repository contains projects for Udacity's [Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analyst-nanodegree--nd008) 

### Project 1: Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics


A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a large set of diamonds, but is unsure how much it should bid. The goal is to use the results from a predictive model to make a recommendation on how much the jewelry company should bid for the diamonds.

### Project 2: Predicting Catalog Demand

A home-goods manufacturer wants to predict expected profits from a catalog launch. The goal is to build a linear regression model to provide results and a
recommendation.

### Project 3: Data Wrangling

A pet store chain is selecting the location for its next store. The goal is to use data preparation techniques to build
a robust analytic dataset and use it to build a predictive model to select the best location.

- P3: [Select Location of a new Pet store](https://github.com/JoshuaOkafor/Udacity-Predictive-Analytics-for-Business-Nanodegree/tree/main/P3%20-%20Data%20Wrangling)

### Project 4: Classification Models

A bank recently received an influx of loan applications. The goal is to build and apply a classification model to
provide a recommendation on which loan applicants the bank should lend to
